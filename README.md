# Drag and Drop Tic Tac Toe

The objective of Drag and Drop Tic Tac Toe is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three objects (X or O) on the game board, indicating a winning move. This version of the game introduces a unique twist by allowing players to drag and drop their objects on the board during their turns.

## Game Setup

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid, similar to traditional Tic Tac Toe.
- Each player has three distinct objects, either X's or O's.

## Gameplay

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns, starting with Player X, and alternate turns.
3. On each turn, a player can drag one of their objects (X or O) and drop it onto an empty cell on the game board.
4. Once a player has placed all three of their objects, they can continue to move their objects around the board on subsequent turns.
5. The game continues until one player successfully forms a line of three of their objects horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, winning the game.

## Winning

- A player wins when they create a line of three of their objects (X's or O's) in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Additional Rules

1. **Object Usage**: Players must use all three of their objects before they can start moving them around the board.

2. **No Moving Other Player's Object**: A player cannot move another player's object.

3. **Drag and Drop Restrictions**: Players must drag and drop their objects onto empty cells.

4. **No Stacking**: Players cannot stack objects on top of each other in a single cell. Each cell can hold only one object.

5. **No Movement in Surrounded Cells**: A player cannot move their object if it is surrounded by other player's objects.
